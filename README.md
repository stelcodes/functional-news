## Why?
I made this mostly to showcase my dev skills. But it would be cool if people used it! :) Ping me if you'd like to see a feature added.

## How?
I'm glad you asked! Here are the tools I used to make this web app come together:
- Clojure: The language used to create the web app
- SCSS: The instructions used to style the interface
- PostgreSQL: The database used to store the app state
- NixOS: The operating system used to host the app on a VM in the cloud

### Clojure
The star of the show! Here is the structural overview of the Clojure code:
```
.
|- deps.edn (Clojure tooling headquarters, declare dependencies and useful aliases)
|- bb.edn (Babashka headquarters, used to run scripts for REPL, Sass, and Postgres tasks)
|- src/codes/stel/functional-news
   |- handler.clj (Reitit router location, and all of the router's handlers)
   |- state.clj (Using next.jdbc, interact with Postgres and get/update the current app state)
   |- views.clj (Using hiccup, create html responses to be consumed by the handlers)
   |- util.clj (General functions go here to be used by all other namespaces)
|- dev
   |- user.clj (Code that executes at the beginning of a REPL session when developing)
```

### SCSS
Making things pretty! Here is the structural overview of the SCSS code:
```
.
|- resources
   |- scss
      |- main.scss (Monolithic stylesheet for all app styling)
      |- reset.scss (A browser styling reset from the css wizard @jgthms)
   |- svg
      |- love.svg (A simple heart SVG from feather icon used for the upvote button)
```

### Postgres
Abolish the state! Wait no not that state! Here is the structural overview of the PostgreSQL code:
```
.
|- resources
   |- sql
      |- schema.sql (The SQL used to initialize the necessary tables in the PostgreSQL database)
```
